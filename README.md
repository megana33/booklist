# Booklist
##Description of project
In my job I feel as though it would be beneficial for parents to have a list of the most popular book sorted by genre that it would be easy to search for. For example, in our catalog system parents and students are able to search by genre but it will return all of the fantasy titles in our library catalog system. I think it would be great to have a site where they are able to enter fantasy and it will return a list of Top Reads titles. These titles can be updated twice a year and take into account library reviews, bestselling books, and must-read lists from a variety of sources. For the purpose of this exercise I used a booklist I have been compiling over the past year and they will include title, author, target age, and genre. The idea would be for them to be able to search by genre and return books that fall within fantasy, realistic fiction, YA, picture books, and award winners. This is not an exhaustive list but could be added to over time.
